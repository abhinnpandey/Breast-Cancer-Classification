# Breast Cancer Classification using Unsupervised Learning

In this project unsupervised machine learning models have been used to classify breast cancer, in Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.

## Dataset Overview

[Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://github.com/abhinnpandey/Breast-Cancer-Classification/blob/master/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification/Breast%20Cancer.csv). It has data of 570 patients. Each row represents unique patient.

**The problem is to determine whether a given patient has Melanoma type of cancer or Benign type of cancer.**

## Implimentation Details
